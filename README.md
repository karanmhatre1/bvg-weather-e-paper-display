Python code for fetching the data from the BVG and Weather APIs and using the data to create a .bin file. Ideal for use on an e-paper display. This particular implementation is for the Waveshare 5.83 e-paper display (648x480).

Please Note: In ``` main.py ``` you will need add a API key from https://www.weatherapi.com/. You will need to create an account to get a key.

``` WEATHER_API_KEY = "ADD YOUR API KEY HERE" ```
